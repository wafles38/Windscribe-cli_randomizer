This is a simply script that will allow you to connect to a random server on Windscribe VPN. Currently on Windscribe CLI v1.4 this is not possible, you are only able to connect to a specific location or to the fastest server (best)

The script will be updated manually as more servers are added or removed from Windscribe. Feel free to let me know if a new server is added by creating an issue. 

Also, you may be able to tell, but I am really bad at conditionals, and programming is not my thing. If you have any suggestions and coding fixes, please let me know! I'll be happy to look at it and update it. Currently the script works perfectly as it is, it may be good for the end user but not for the programmer.

# To do:
-Consider using arrays instead
-Consider having a one liner to define variables
